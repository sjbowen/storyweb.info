# storyweb.info
Story:Web is a concept that explores what happens if we consider museum collections and publicly shared creative media as ‘big data,’ where objects, images, and sounds can be linked to tell the larger stories about climate change.

Story:Web was a finalist in the Reimagining Museums for Climate Action design challenge and will be exhibited at the Glasgow Science Centre from June to October 2021 on the lead up to COP26 (the UN Climate Change Conference).

This repository contains the code for the embryonic Story:Web website (storyweb.info) and - in time - the code for the autonomous aspects of Story:Web.

Story:Web is collaboration between Simon Bowen at [Open Lab at Newcastle University](https://openlab.ncl.ac.uk/), Sarah Mander at [Tyndall Centre for Climate Change Research](https://www.tyndall.ac.uk/) and [The Centre for Climate Change and Social Transitions](https://cast.ac.uk/), the [Great North Museum: Hancock](https://greatnorthmuseum.org.uk/), and contemporary musician, field recordist and sound artist [David de la Haye ](https://daviddelahaye.co.uk/).
