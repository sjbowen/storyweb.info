	<p>The Grey Seal grows up to three metres long and over 200kg in weight, and is one of Britain’s largest native predator. The UK supports about half of the global population of the species, over 100,000 seals. As populations have increased, the seals have spread looking for new places to ‘haul out’ and to breed. The largest colonies are in Scotland, but another famous local colony is found on Northumberland’s rocky, inaccessible Farne Islands which provide seals with an ideal refuge to rear their pups. </p>

	<p>As seals spread along the Eastern coast of the UK, they are hauling out in places that probably haven’t seen seals in decades. One spot, down the coast from the Farnes, is St Mary’s Island, a rocky headland and tidal island just north of Whitley Bay. While older residents can’t recall seeing seals in any numbers here when they were young, these days it’s rare to visit without spotting a few seals resting on outermost rocks of the island. And in places like this, the consequences of better seal conservation can lead to conflict. Seal conservationists are vocal about the threats posed by disturbance to the new arrivals, while local communities want to live and behave on the coast just as they always have.</p>

	<p>The future of Britain’s seals looks much more secure than it has done for more than a century. However, along with everything else on the planet, seals do face emerging threats from climate change. Storms are one of the biggest threats to seal pups, and the increasingly extreme weather of the warmer climate is an unknown risk to vulnerable young seals in their coastal colonies. As sea levels rise, the protected shorelines that host the haul out sites could be inundated. Extensive human development along coastlines does not provide them with many alternatives. Squeezed between a rising sea and built up shore, seals of the future may struggle to find a home.</p>

	<p>Small low-lying islands are at risk from climate change and in places around the world, tsunamis. Hulhumale' in the Maldives is a new island and was built to house a growing population near to the capital city. It was built to a height of 2m above mean sea-level - high to withstand tsunamis, and as a by-product sea-level rise. The island now has a large population and will be safe from rising sea-levels for many decades.</p>

	<p>St Cuthbert (CE 634 – CE 687) was an Anglo-Saxon Saint and bishop who lived as a hermit on the Farne Islands from 676 - 685. He was said to have great affinity for nature and helped protect the local wildlife. St Cuthbert has been described as an early conservationist.</p>
