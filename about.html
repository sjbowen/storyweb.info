	<p>“When we got to the docks my dad said ‘let’s look at the big liners’ and the one he picked on was the Montclare… My dad and mum said ‘let’s go on board and have a look around’… but unknown to me that was the start of our new life; dad said we were going for a ride and after quite a few days we arrived at Pictou Harbour, Nova Scotia.” J Clark<br />
