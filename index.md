**Story:Web** is an idea that reimagines museums for climate action – taking them from place-based holders of the past to collectively curated, global, big-data resources that can be accessed and experienced, remotely from across the world.

**Story:Web** explores what happens if we consider museum collections as big data, linked with other organisations’ collections and with publicly shared media on websites such as Flickr and Bandcamp. In this way every collection object or media item becomes a **Story:Snippet**, which can be linked by different authors to tell larger stories. 

This **Story:Web** of big data can then be mined, shared and contributed to both by humans and non-humans (artificial intelligences). **Story:Webs** and **Story:Snippets** support new ways of storytelling, with museums and the public as co-authors and co-curators, which encourage discovery, reflection, and action. 

**Story:Web** will be exhibited at the [Glasgow Science Centre](https://www.glasgowsciencecentre.org/) from June to October 2021 on the lead up to [COP26 - the UN Climate Change Conference ](https://ukcop26.org/) in Glasgow.


## More on the Story:Web Concept
Museum collections are more than objects, they are objects with stories that should evoke emotional responses and provoke reflection. Collections can sometimes lose their power to amaze, by being fixed in time and perspective.  

The web allows the sharing and reuse of public domain media including photographs, video, and sound created by professionals and enthusiasts. Yet this rich catalogue can be lost more widely.  

**Story:Web** is an innovative idea to use existing technology to connect museum collections and publicly shared media to rewrite stories, grow them and make them personal, co-authored by museums and the public in general to stimulate thought and action. 

**Story:Web** uses metadata, artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms, and human-centred interfaces to link, visualise and produce sound from a dynamic and extensible web of data (text, audio, images, datasets) as Story:Snippets. Snippets can be linked in different ways, by different people, to tell different stories, moving museum collections away from being assembled solely by professionals, privileging western stories and ideas, with some objects distant from their source communities. 

Snippets and interconnections could be contributed to **Story:Web** by anyone – members of the public, campaigners or professionals, and by the **Story:Web** AI discovering snippets from other digital collections and publicly shared social media.  

**Story:Web** encourages discovery, reflection and action through interactions that cycle between large sets of data (webs) and small details (snippets), and creates an immersive experience via images and sound. By using **Story:Web** anyone can discover and link **Story:Snippets**. In this way, storytelling goes beyond the museum to enable diverse people and groups to tell stories that are seen through their own values, culture and experiences.  

AIs will add a climate change dimension to the **Story:Web** by linking climate change impacts and solution Snippets within the web. Within the co-curated stories, these snippets will make explicit the ecological, social and cultural dimensions of the environmental change that has been driven by human actions, at different time-scales, empowering action by discovering, revealing and sharing.

## The Story:Web Team
**Story:Web** is a new project from Simon Bowen at [Open Lab](), Sarah Mander at [Tyndall Centre for Climate Change Research](https://www.tyndall.ac.uk/) and [The Centre for Climate Change and Social Transitions](https://cast.ac.uk/), [the Great North Museum: Hancock](https://greatnorthmuseum.org.uk/), and contemporary musician, field recordist and sound artist [David de la Haye](https://daviddelahaye.co.uk/) - the creative and scientific partnership behind the innovative climate change engagement installations [Here and Now](https://hereandnowchange.net/hereandnow.html) and [Making Marks](https://youtu.be/IIvTDEmxCEQ), the latter hosted as part of The Great North Museum:Hancock’s [Dippy on Tour](https://www.artfund.org/whats-on/exhibitions/2019/10/19/dippy-on-tour-exhibition) programme which centred around Climate Change and biodiversity loss.
